Firstly, I would like to thank my supervisor, Nik Cunniffe. Thank you Nik for your guidance, encouragement and trust over the last few years. I have really appreciated your sharp eye and quick wit, and I've enjoyed working with you. I'd also like to thank my co-supervisor Chris Gilligan---it has been a pleasure working with you.

Thank you to the BBSRC for funding my PhD through a DTP studentship, and to the programme for the cohort events. I'm grateful to the Department of Plant Sciences, not forgetting Annie in the tea room. I'd also like to acknowledge my college, Jesus, for making me feel at home over the last 8 years. Particular thanks go to Noel Rutter, Jim Bellingham and Si\^{a}n Dutton for your support during both my undergraduate course and PhD. Thanks also for supervising and interviewing opportunities.

I'd like to thank all the members, both past and present, of the Computational and Theoretical Epidemiology group, and the Epidemiology and Modelling group. You have all made this experience much more enjoyable. I'd particularly like to thank Clare Allen, Andrew Craig, Eleftherios Avramidis, Sally Hames and especially Ciara Dangerfield for your support, encouragement and friendship.

Last, but certainly not least, I'd like to thank all my friends and family. Thanks to my housemates for your fun and friendship. A big thank you to Lisa for proofreading. To my parents, my brother Luke, and Lisa: thank you all for your love and support over the years. I really appreciate your belief in me.
