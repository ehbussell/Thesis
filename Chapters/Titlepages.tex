This dissertation is the the result of my own work and includes nothing which is the outcome
of work done in collaboration except as declared in the Preface and specified in the text.

This dissertation is not substantially the same as any that I have submitted, or, is being
concurrently submitted for a degree or diploma or other qualification at the University of
Cambridge or any other University or similar institution except as declared in the Preface and
specified in the text. I further state that no substantial part of my dissertation has already
been submitted, or, is being concurrently submitted for any such degree, diploma or other
qualification at the University of Cambridge or any other University or similar institution
except as declared in the Preface and specified in the text.

This dissertation does not exceed the prescribed word limit of 60,000 words (excluding
bibliography, figures and appendices) as specified by the Degree Committee of the Faculty
of Biology.
